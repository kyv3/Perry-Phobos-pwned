reason i posted this : steal my discord more! 
+ full credit to [kambing](https://github.com/ProfKambing) for leaking the src
+ also credits for rte for being cool

# Building

+ open cmd and type cd (path to the folder)
+ then type gradlew.bat setupdecompworkspace
+ and gradlew build
+ the jar should be in build/libs folder
I am aware that perry phobos code is lisenced but because the code isnt made by perry he has no legal right to dmca.
i will fight all dmcas not coming from phobos developers.


# Story (kambing)
So perry removed my repo access like 2 months ago but bush had a fork of the main repo and it was visible for me.. lol (more funny shit coming soon)
